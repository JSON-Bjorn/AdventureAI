Dice Rolling Utility Class

A static utility class for handling probability and random events.
Not an agent - provides pure functions for random number generation.

Core Functions:
    roll_dice(sides: int, advantage: bool = False) -> int:
        Rolls a die with specified number of sides. Handles advantage/disadvantage.

    check_difficulty(action: str, context: dict) -> bool:
        Determines if an action succeeds based on difficulty and modifiers.

    calculate_success_chance(stats: dict, difficulty: int) -> float:
        Calculates probability of success for an action.

    generate_loot_roll(rarity: str) -> dict:
        Generates random loot based on rarity tables.

Technical Implementation:
    - Uses cryptographically secure RNG via secrets module
    - Supports dice from d4 to d100
    - Implements advantage/disadvantage system (+/- rolls)
    - Tracks critical successes (natural 20) and failures (natural 1)
    - Maintains statistics for balancing

Integration Points:
    - CombatAgent: Attack rolls and damage
    - LootAgent: Drop chance calculations
    - NPCAgent: Interaction outcomes
    - TextAgent: Story branch probability
