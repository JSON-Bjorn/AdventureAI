PostgreSQL Database Interface

A streamlined database interface using SQLAlchemy for game state persistence.
Not an agent - simply handles CRUD operations and data management.

Schema:
    - Characters (player characters and states)
    - NPCs (non-player characters and monsters)
    - Items (equipment, consumables, quest items)
    - Effects (buffs, debuffs, status effects)
    - Story_Progress (game state and choices)
    - Combat_Log (battle history)
    - Inventory (character possessions)
    - Media_Cache (stored images and sounds)

Technical Implementation:
    - SQLAlchemy ORM
    - Connection pooling
    - Transaction management
    - Data validation
    - Migration handling
    - Backup systems

Key Methods:
    - save_game_state()
    - load_game_state()
    - update_character()
    - store_media()
    - get_npc_data()
    - log_combat()
    etc.
