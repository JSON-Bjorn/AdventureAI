class DiceAgent:
    pass


"""Makes a dice roll based on when the player is trying to do a more than trivial task. For normal tasks as walking and brushing teeth, it doesnt make a roll. 
For attacking dragons and doing taxes, it should. Might implement an agent to calculate the difficulty of each task (DifficultyAgent?) or its handled here.
Stores rolls in DatabaseAgent. Works together with TextAgent and ImageAgent in how the story should proceed based on the outcome."""
